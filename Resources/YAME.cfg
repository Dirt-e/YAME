#USE THIS FILE WISELY!!!

#If you absolutely MUST override these safety relevant settings (Do you REALLY?), 
#you can remove the '#' to override some settings in YAME.

#But please, be aware that these safety features were implemented to catch some major
#sources of user error. If used as intended, YAME should never bug you with 
#nuisance warnings. That being said, some people may want to take matters into their
#own hands...
