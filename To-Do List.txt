To-Do:

MAIN WINDOW:
- Implement a "Save Resources" button to...
		- Close all child windows
		- Resize MainWindow
		- Maybe create a screen overlay?
- Save "SimName in profile
- Show name of active profile in MainWindow when loaded

CRASH DETECTION & RECOVERY:

INTEGRATOR:
- Implement some sort of DOF limit to keep the Transform3D from exceeding reasonable values (+/- 30° or so), because 
	excessive angles could lead to erratic "snapping" during the quaternion interpolation (shortest path problem)

SERIALTALKER:
-SerialConnectionWindow: "OPEN" should indicate green

RIG CONFIGURATION:
- Add a slew mode for apropriate offsets. May be used during an open serial connection!

LOADER/SAVER:

ALPHA_COMPENSATION:

POSITION OFFSET CORRECTION:
- Check offset correction working. Debug
- Toggle needs a green "Active" indicator (like the a-compensation)
