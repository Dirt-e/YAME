To-Do:

MAIN WINDOW:
+ Display framerate in Mainwindow Titlebar
+ open Sceneview once on Startup to prevent framerate drop to 60FPS
- Implement a "Save Resources" button to...
		- Close all child windows
		- Resize MainWindow
		- Maybe create a screen overlay?
- Save "SimName in profile
- Show name of active profile in MainWindow when loaded

CRASH DETECTION & RECOVERY:
+ Do not allow to lerp to MOTION while...
		+ exceedance present or
		+ previous Crash state not acknoledged.
+ If Crash triggered while lerping from PAUSE to MOTION --> Reverse direction (potential hard reversal!)
+ Do not allow Crash reset while exceedance is present
- Show the values in the Crashdetector/RawData Window that triggered the exceedance in red color/font.

INTEGRATOR:
- Implement some sort of DOF limit to keep the Transform3D from exceeding reasonable values (+/- 30° or so), because 
	excessive angles could lead to erratic "snapping" during the quaternion interpolation (shortest path problem)

SERIALTALKER:
+ Prevent user from changing COM port while port is open
+ Provide ErrorMessage when serial connection times out
+ IMPORTANT! Do not allow SerialPort to be openend while the MessaGegenerator produces anything 
	other than <0><0> on all actuators.
+ Add support for M4S controller.
- Make the SerialTalker remember the last used COM port (If that is available in the dropdown list)

RIG CONFIGURATION:
+ Do not allow RigConfig to be changed while a SerialConnection is open.
- Add a slew mode for apropriate offsets. May be used during an open serial connection!

LOADER/SAVER:
+ Do not allow to load a profile while a serial connection is open (potential hard-over!)
