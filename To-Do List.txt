To-Do:
GENERAL:
- Implement window snapping when draging

- Show name of active profile in MainWindow when loaded

CRASH DETECTION & RECOVERY:

INTEGRATOR:

  exceeding reasonable values (+/- 30° or so), because
  excessive angles could lead to erratic "snapping" during 
  quaternion interpolation (shortest path problem)

FILTERS WINDOW:
- Add input motion data on left side of window (Ax, Ay, Az,.....)

RIG CONFIGURATION:
- Add a slew mode for apropriate offsets. May be used during an open serial connection!
- Warning image should show while Serial connection open -> Debug

LOADER/SAVER:

ALPHA_COMPENSATION:

POSITION OFFSET CORRECTION:
