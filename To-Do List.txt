To-Do:
GENERAL:
- SnappyDragger: Snap Windows to borders of screen

MAIN WINDOW:
- Save "SimName in profile

CRASH DETECTION & RECOVERY:

INTEGRATOR:
- Implement some sort of DOF limit to keep the Transform3D from
  exceeding reasonable values (+/- 30° or so), because
  excessive angles could lead to erratic "snapping" during 
  quaternion interpolation (shortest path problem)

SERIALTALKER:

FILTERS WINDOW:
- Add input motion data on left side of window (Ax, Ay, Az,.....)

RIG CONFIGURATION:
- Add a slew mode for apropriate offsets. May be used during an open serial connection!

LOADER/SAVER:
- Split Load/Save routine up into "Rig" and "Filters"

ALPHA_COMPENSATION:

POSITION OFFSET CORRECTION:
