To-Do:
GENERAL:
- SnappyDragger: Constrain window to within screen area! IMPORTANT!!!

MAIN WINDOW:


CRASH DETECTION & RECOVERY:


INTEGRATOR:
- Implement some sort of DOF limit to keep the Transform3D from
  exceeding reasonable values (+/- 30° or so), because
  excessive angles could lead to erratic "snapping" during 
  quaternion interpolation (shortest path problem)


SERIALTALKER:
- Allow more flexible Odrive assignments (like @PeterW)


FILTERS WINDOW:


RIG CONFIGURATION:
- Add a slew mode for apropriate offsets. May be used during an open serial connection!


LOADER/SAVER:
- Split Load/Save routine up into "Rig" and "Filters"


ALPHA_COMPENSATION:


POSITION OFFSET CORRECTION:

PATCHER:
- Re-apply DCS Patch if already patched. Just to be sure!
- Make FS2020_Motion_Exporter invisible
- Make FS2020_Motion_Exporter close appplication when Flightsimulator closes


SAFETY:
- Make ActuatorOverride "Foolproof"
- Make DOF Override "Foolproof"

MOTION CONTROL:
- Allow free lerping between Park/Pause/Motion (via LP Filters and/or PerlinSmooth transitions),maybe even reversible transitions

Scene View:
- Show ghost platform(s)
- Show CoR as yellow ball
