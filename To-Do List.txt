To-Do:
GENERAL:


MAIN WINDOW:


CRASH DETECTION & RECOVERY:

INVERTER:


INTEGRATOR:
- Implement some sort of DOF limit to keep the Transform3D from
  exceeding reasonable values (+/- 30° or so), because
  excessive angles could lead to erratic "snapping" during 
  quaternion interpolation (shortest path problem)

ACTUATOR OVERRIDE:

SERIALTALKER:

FILTERS WINDOW:
- Let scaling factor transition smoothly upon changes
- Prevent Ay from jumping because of sudden onset of 9,81m/s² on startup. Filter needs to be equalised shortly after startup

RIG CONFIGURATION:
- Add a slew mode for apropriate offsets. May be used during an open serial connection!


LOADER/SAVER:
- Split Load/Save routine up into "Rig" and "Filters"


ALPHA_COMPENSATION:


POSITION OFFSET CORRECTION:

PATCHER:
- Re-apply DCS Patch if already patched. Just to be sure!


SAFETY:

MOTION CONTROL:

Scene View:
- Show ghost platform(s)
- Show CoR as yellow ball
