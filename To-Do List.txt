To-Do:
GENERAL:
- SnappyDragger: Snap Windows to borders of screen
- SnappyDragger: Make Windows snap independently in vertical and horizontal direction
- Add "ActuatorWindow" to show individual actuators
- Mark the content of a TextBox when entering focus (to be able ot overwrite the contents quickly)

MAIN WINDOW:
- Save "SimName in profile

CRASH DETECTION & RECOVERY:

INTEGRATOR:
- Implement some sort of DOF limit to keep the Transform3D from
  exceeding reasonable values (+/- 30° or so), because
  excessive angles could lead to erratic "snapping" during 
  quaternion interpolation (shortest path problem)

SERIALTALKER:

FILTERS WINDOW:

RIG CONFIGURATION:
- Add a slew mode for apropriate offsets. May be used during an open serial connection!
- Make sure the calibration feature is used only when either...
	- ...no data is coming in from the sim
	- ...sim data is not taken into account for the calibration process

LOADER/SAVER:
- Split Load/Save routine up into "Rig" and "Filters"

ALPHA_COMPENSATION:

POSITION OFFSET CORRECTION:

PATCHER:
- Re-apply DCS Patch if already patched. Just to be sure!
